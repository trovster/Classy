Classy
======

Classy is a set of classes for WordPress, which wraps post types (Posts, Pages and custom post types) and users in a class.
It includes common methods which replicate built in functionality (such as `the_content` and `the_permalink`), but means you
can easily override their behaviour per post type without having to modify the view template files.

The codebase also includes some started classes for custom post types, such as “People” and “Features Boxes”, and their
corresponding view template files.
